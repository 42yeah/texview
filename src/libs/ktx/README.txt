This is a stripped down version of libktx from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software

It only contains what's needed to *read* KTX1 and KTX2 files, including KTX2 files
containing Basis Universal textures, and ones using deflate (zlib) or zstd compression.

Most of this is under Apache 2.0 license (see Apache-2.0.txt), some of the contained
thirdparty code uses different licenses, which can be found in the corresponding folders.
